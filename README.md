## Introduction
**Family Planning Estimation Tool**, or **FPET**, is a web application available at http://spark.rstudio.com/jrnew/FPET.

This web application is a country-specific implementation of the estimation approach for contraceptive prevalence and unmet need for family planning used by the <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/population/">United Nations Population Division (UNPD)</a>. The global implementation of the estimation approach is described in: Alkema, L. et al. (2013). <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)62204-1/abstract">National, regional and global rates and trends in contraceptive prevalence and unmet need for family planning between 1990 and 2015: a systematic and comprehensive analysis</a>. Lancet, 2013, 381(9878):1642-1652.

**FPET** was created in R with the package Shiny. The default database loaded in **FPET** is the UNPD World Contraceptive Use 2012 database, which is available at <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/WCU2012/MainFrame.html">World Contraceptive Use 2012</a>.
